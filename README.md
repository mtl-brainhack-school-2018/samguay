# mtl_brainhack_school_project

#### This is the repo for the project I've been working on during the [MONTREAL BRAINHACK SCHOOL](https://brainhackmtl.github.io/school2018/) from May 14th to June 1st 2018.

:zap: Very high is the probability I'll be working on some sports-related concussions data :zap:

This school is an amazing opportunity for me to finally try and learn about differents tools I have heard for some time. Since I am only at the beginning of my data acquisition, I'd like to work on a couple of things on some different level:

* Learn about __[Loris](http://loris.ca/)__ and properly set it up locally on my machine so I! I have more than 10 different questionnaires, from personality assessment to sleep behaviors, anxiety, etc.. 

* I have some data that I'd like to quantitatively analyse using __[QMRLab](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMRLab)__ that __[Agah](https://github.com/agahkarakuzu)__ (also a 2018 participant :arrow_right: [his school repo here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2018/agahkarakuzu)).
